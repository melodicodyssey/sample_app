This is a sample Rails application meant to illustrate how MVC/route behavior works.

To use this app, clone it into your local repository, then run:

bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rails s

And you should be good to go to localhost:3000!  Feel free to navigate through the application while viewing the code here on Github.  The .rb files are heavily commented to narrate the process that is occurring.

If you feel any changes/additions need to be made to increase the teaching power of this appliation, please let me know!
